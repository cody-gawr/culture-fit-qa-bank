### ðŸŒŸ **General Introduction**

1. **Can you please introduce yourself and give us a brief overview of your professional background?**
   **Answer:**

   "Hi, Iâ€™m Lautaro, and Iâ€™ve been working as a frontend developer for about **5+ years now**, with a strong focus on **Angular** over the past **3 to 4 years**. I started my career building responsive websites using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, then gradually moved into frameworks like **Angular** as I took on more complex projects.

   In my recent roles, Iâ€™ve been mainly responsible for developing **scalable, modular, and high-performance Angular applications**, working closely with backend teams to integrate APIs, and also optimizing apps for speed and responsiveness.

   Along the way, Iâ€™ve gained solid experience with **RxJS, NgRx for state management**, and frontend tools like **TypeScript, SCSS, and Webpack**. I enjoy solving UI challenges, improving user experience, and keeping up with the latest in frontend tech.

   Overall, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m passionate about clean code, best practices, and delivering products that users love."

2. **What motivated you to pursue a career in Frontend development?**

   **Answer-1:**

   "Honestly, what got me into frontend development is the fact that you can **see your work come to life** right away. I really enjoy building things that users actually interact with â€” whether it's making a page look great, or making sure an app feels smooth and responsive.

   Iâ€™ve always been interested in the combination of **design and logic** â€” and frontend development is right in the middle of that. Plus, with frameworks like **Angular**, thereâ€™s always something new to learn, and I like the challenge of improving both the user experience and the performance of apps."

   **Answer-2:**

   "What really motivated me to get into frontend development is the fact that itâ€™s where **users connect with the product**. The frontend directly shapes how users feel about an app or website, and even small improvements can make a big difference in terms of engagement and business results.

   I enjoy not just coding, but also thinking about **user experience, performance, and accessibility** â€” making sure the app is not only functional but also enjoyable and easy to use. And with frameworks like **Angular**, there's a lot of room to build scalable, maintainable solutions that can really support product growth. That balance of technical challenge and real-world impact is what keeps me excited about frontend development."

3. **How did you get started with Angular (or frontend technologies in general)?**

   **Answer:**

   "I got started with frontend by first working on basic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** projects â€” things like building static websites and learning how to make pages interactive. As I got more into it, I started exploring **jQuery** and some smaller libraries, but I realized I wanted to build more structured and scalable applications.

   Thatâ€™s when I picked up **Angular**, starting with smaller projects and gradually moving into more complex enterprise apps. I liked how Angular provided a full framework with things like **routing, services, and dependency injection** all built in. Over time, I got comfortable with **TypeScript, RxJS, and state management**, and now Angular is my main tool for building frontend applications."

4. **What do you enjoy most about working in frontend development?**

   **Answer:**

   "What I really enjoy about frontend development is the fact that itâ€™s where **the user experience comes to life**. Itâ€™s not just about making things look nice â€” itâ€™s about making sure the app is **fast, accessible, and easy to use**, which directly impacts how users feel about the product and even the business outcomes.

   I also like the balance between **technical challenges** â€” like optimizing performance or managing complex state â€” and the creative side, where youâ€™re crafting the actual experience people have. Plus, in frontend, thereâ€™s always something evolving, which keeps things interesting and pushes me to keep improving."

5. **Walk me through your typical workday as a frontend developer in your last role.**
   **Answer:**

   "Sure! A typical day for me started with a **daily standup**, where Iâ€™d sync up with the team on progress, blockers, and plans for the day. After that, I usually spent time **coding features or fixing bugs**, mostly in **Angular**, working on components, services, and API integrations.

   Part of the day would go into **code reviews**, both giving feedback to others and improving my own work based on peer reviews. I also worked closely with **backend developers** to align on APIs, and with **designers** to make sure the UI matched the intended experience.

   When needed, Iâ€™d jump into debugging sessions, optimize performance, or handle **responsive design tweaks** to make sure things looked good across devices. And of course, Iâ€™d usually wrap up the day by updating tasks on **Jira** or whatever tool we were using, and preparing for the next sprint.

   So overall, it was a mix of coding, collaboration, and problem-solving â€” pretty balanced between independent work and team interaction."

6.  **How do you keep your frontend skills up to date with the latest technologies and best practices?**

    **Answer:**

    "I try to stay up to date by making **learning a regular habit**. I follow some key blogs and websites like **Angular Blog, CSS-Tricks, and Smashing Magazine** to keep an eye on new updates and best practices. I also watch talks from conferences like **ng-conf** or **Google I/O**, which are great for spotting trends early.

    When thereâ€™s a new feature or tool, I like to **experiment with small side projects** or try things out in isolated branches before using them in real projects. And of course, just by doing **code reviews and collaborating** with other devs, I pick up a lot of practical insights on better patterns and approaches.

    So itâ€™s a mix of reading, watching, hands-on practice, and learning from peers â€” keeps things fresh and helps me grow consistently."

7.  **Do you have experience working in Agile/Scrum environments? Could you describe it?**

    **Answer:**

    Yes, Iâ€™ve worked extensively in **Agile/Scrum** environments, especially during my time developing a dental clinic management solution. We followed a typical Scrum setup with **two-week sprints**, **daily stand-ups**, **sprint planning**, and **retrospectives**.

    As a front-end developer focusing on Angular, I collaborated closely with backend devs and product owners to build responsive, user-friendly interfaces for modules like appointment scheduling, patient records, and billing. We used **Jira** to manage tasks and **Confluence** for documentation. **Agile** helped us iterate quickly, respond to real-time feedback from stakeholders, and consistently deliver new features without piling up technical debt.

8.  **Whatâ€™s your preferred tech stack for frontend projects and why?**

    **Answer:**
    For most frontend projects, my go-to stack starts with **Angular**â€”I really like how structured and scalable it is, especially for enterprise-level apps. I usually pair it with **TypeScript** of course, and for state management, I prefer **NgRx** when things get complex, or **RxJS** patterns for lighter apps.

    For styling, I go with **SCSS** or **Tailwind CSS** depending on the projectâ€”Tailwindâ€™s great for speed and consistency. I also use **Angular Material** a lot to speed up UI development and keep things looking clean.

    Testing-wise, I like **Jasmine/Karma** for unit tests and **Cypress** for end-to-end. And when it comes to tooling, **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **Husky** help keep the codebase clean and the team aligned.

    Overall, this stack gives me a good balance of productivity, performance, and maintainability.
